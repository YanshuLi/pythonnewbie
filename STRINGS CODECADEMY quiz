#for newbie like me, looking at the code just created, thinking there must be a simpler way, a more elegant more intelligent way to write 
#it that does the same function, but...for now this is what I can think of.....

#and here is the comparision.....

#Let’s start with username_generator. Create a function called username_generator take two inputs, first_name and last_name and returns a username. The username should be a slice of the first three letters of their first name and the first four letters of their last name. If their first name is less than three letters or their last name is less than four letters it should use their entire names.

#For example, if the employee’s name is Abe Simpson the function should generate the username AbeSimp.

#my answer
def username_generator(first_name, last_name):
  if len(first_name) > 3 and len(last_name) > 4:
    username = first_name[:3] + last_name[:4];
    return username
  if len(first_name) <= 3 and len(last_name) > 4:
    username = first_name + last_name[:4];
    return username
  if len(first_name) > 3 and len(last_name) <= 4:
    username = first_name[:3] + last_name
    return username
  else:
    username = first_name + last_name
    return username

print(username_generator("Abe", "Simpson"))

def username_generator(first_name, last_name):
    if len(first_name) < 3:
        user_name = first_name
    else:
        user_name = first_name[0:3]
    if len(last_name) < 4:
        user_name += last_name
    else:
        user_name += last_name[0:4]
    return user_name
    

#Create another list called author_last_names that only contains the last names of the poets in the provided string.

authors = "Audre Lorde,Gabriela Mistral,Jean Toomer,An Qi,Walt Whitman,Shel Silverstein,Carmen Boullosa,Kamala Suraiyya,Langston Hughes,Adrienne Rich,Nikki Giovanni"

author_names = authors.split(',')

print(author_names)

author_last_name = []
for names in author_names:
  full_name = names.split()
  author_last_name.append(full_name[-1])

print(author_last_name)

#CODECADEMY ANSWER

author_last_name = []
  author_last_name.append(names.split()[-1])
