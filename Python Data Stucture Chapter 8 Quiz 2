fname = input("Enter file name: ")

try:
    fh = open(fname)
except:
    print("File cannot be opened:", fname)

count = 0

for line in fh:
    line = line.rstrip()
    words = line.split()
    if not line.startswith('From '):
         continue
    words = line.split()
    print(words[1])
    count = count + 1
     
print("There were", count, "lines in the file with From as the first word")
