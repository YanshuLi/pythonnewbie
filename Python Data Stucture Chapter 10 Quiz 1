# answer to Python Data Stucture chapter 10 assignment 1:

name = input("Enter file:")
if len(name) < 1 : name = "mbox-short.txt"
handle = open(name)

#above lines were given
#as a beginner, my code would be:
#
# try:
# name = input("Enter file:")
# except:
# print("Can't open file::, name)
#
# handle = open(name)

counts = dict()

for line in handle:
    if not line.startswith('From '):
        continue
    else:
        time_sent = line.split()
        time = time_sent[5]
        hour = time.split(":")
        counts[hour[0]] = counts.get(hour[0], 0) + 1

list = list()
for k, v in counts.items():
    list.append( (k, v) )
list.sort()

for hour_sent, counts in list:
    print(hour_sent, counts)
